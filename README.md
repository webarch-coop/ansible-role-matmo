# Ansible Matomo

This repository contains an Ansible role for installing and upgrading [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) servers, based on the [ExtraTools plugin](https://github.com/digitalist-se/extratools) for the install and the [manual upgrade steps](https://matomo.org/docs/update/#the-manual-three-step-update).

To use this role you need to use Ansible Galaxy to install it into another repository by adding a `requirements.yml` file in that repo that contains:

```yml
---
- name: matomo
  src: https://git.coop/webarch/matomo.git
  version: master
  scm: git
```

To pull this repo in run:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --force -p galaxy/roles 
```

The other repo should also contain a `matomo.yml` file that contains:

```yml
---
- name: Upgrade Matomo
  become: yes

  hosts: matomo_servers

  vars:
    matomo_user: stats
    matomo_home: "/home/{{ matomo_user }}"
    matomo_html: "{{ matomo_home }}/sites/default"
    matomo_private: "{{ matomo_home }}/private"
    matomo_db_username: "{{ matomo_user }}"
    matomo_db_pass: ""
    matomo_db_host: localhost
    matomo_db_name: "{{ matomo_user }}"
    matomo_first_site_name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    matomo_first_site_url: "https://{{ inventory_hostname }}/"
    matomo_first_user: "Webarchitects"
    matomo_first_user_email: "root@{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    matomo_first_user_pass: ""

  roles:
    - matomo
```

And a `hosts.yml` file that contains a `matomo_servers` list as follows: 

```yml
---
all:
  children:
    matomo_servers:
      hosts:
        host1.example.org:
        host2.example.org:
```

Only the first four variables above are needed for upgrades, the other variables are only needed for the install, if a `~/.my.cnf` exists the database passwd is taken from there, the database name and user defaults to `matomo_user`, if the first user password is not set a random one is generated and sent via SMTP, port 25 on the server to the user.

Then it can be run as follows:

```
bash
ansible-playbook matomo.yml -i hosts.yml
``` 

The `adduser.yml` and `deleteusers.yml` tasks can be called from other roles, for example:

```yml
- name: Include delete user tasks from Matomo role
  include_role:
    name: matomo
    tasks_from: deleteuser.yml
  vars:
    matomo_login: "{{ item.key }}"
    matomo_login_email: "{{ item.value.users_email }}"
```

The `addsite.yml` tasks are not ready for production use due to the [site:add allows duplicates](https://github.com/digitalist-se/extratools/issues/9) issue.
